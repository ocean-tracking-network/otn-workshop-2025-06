**NOTE** This is an archive of OTN's core suite of workshop curricula, created in June 2025. This workshop will use older format OTN Detection Extracts. The new workshop material is available at [https://ocean-tracking-network.github.io/otn-workshop-base/](https://ocean-tracking-network.github.io/otn-workshop-base/).
 
This pair of workshops will introduce the R programming language, popular in the field of biologging.

In session one we will explore some of the popular software packages suitable for exploring and plotting acoustic telemetry data, including `dplyr` and `ggplot2`, for the purpose of generating summaries for reports.

The second session offers a brief overview of the `glatos` R package for performing detection filtering, various calculations and plotting. The data is then transformed for ingestion into the powerful acoustic telemetry packages `remora` and `actel`, along with examples from each package.
